# Contributing

Welcome to the Eclipse AASX Package Explorer repository. 

If you are joining the project from the previous repository at admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer, please see the [Migrating](#migrating) section below to get started in the new repository.

The [Contribution guildelines](#contribution-guidelines) section includes general guidelines as well as additional quirks specific to Eclipse Foundation projects, so it is definitely worth a read as well.

## Migrating

AASX Package Explorer is an Eclipse Foundation incubated project and therefore needs to adhere to Eclipse Foundation rules.
This introduces a slight overhead for every contributor, at least at the very begginning, but it's worth it!

Here are the steps to begin contributing to the Eclipse AASX Package Explorer (and any other project under the Eclipse Foundation umbrella):

1. create an account at the Eclipse Foundation website
    - make sure to add your github name
1. become a Contributor to Eclipse AASX Package Explorer
1. pull request
1. happily develop ever after

      or...

4. contact a Project Lead or a Committer to be nominated to a Committer yourself (and receive more repository priviledges, such as ability to merge)
